## Hello, World! 👋
🌟 Welcome to my GitHub! I’m Elizabeth Drew, a Backend Software Engineer with a zest for coding and a knack for rapid learning. Just two years ago, I embarked on my coding journey and haven’t looked back since!

## Who Am I? 🚀
I’m a tech enthusiast currently weaving magic with Java, Spring Boot, Docker, and Kubernetes. By day, I’m a Software Developer at Coutts, diving deep into microservices and REST APIs. By night, I turn into an e-commerce wizard as the owner of Osmology, where I blend technology with entrepreneurship to deliver outstanding customer experiences.

## My Mission 🌍
I believe in the power of technology to make a difference, especially in making financial services accessible to all — not just the elite. Here, you’ll find projects that reflect my commitment to inclusivity and my passion for fintech innovation.

## What’s Cooking? 🍳
Check out my repositories for a taste of what I’ve been up to:

### Networth Tracker Application: 
A microservice marvel helping users track their financial health. It’s a concoction of Java, Spring, Docker, and Kubernetes, seasoned with a sprinkle of Prometheus and Grafana for that extra zing.

## Let’s Connect! 🤝
If my projects pique your interest or you just want to chat tech, fintech, or anything in between, feel free to reach out! Also, I’m always on the lookout for feedback and collaboration to make banking better for everyone.
