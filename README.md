## From simple automations to reliable systems

I design and implement structured automation systems for SMEs, freelancers, and growing teams.

Low-code tools like Make.com make it easy to build workflows. What’s less obvious is how to manage them safely as they grow.

My work focuses on:

- Designing maintainable automation architecture  
- Introducing version control and change visibility  
- Setting up sensible dev / test / production workflows  
- Refactoring fragile or overly complex automation  
- Applying engineering discipline without over-engineering

## Background

I first began using low-code automation while running my own e-commerce business. During Covid restrictions, automation became the only way to scale operations without hiring additional staff. 

After successfully exiting the business, I moved into backend engineering roles within regulated banking environments, working with Java, Python, and enterprise integration systems.

Today, my perspective sits between SME pragmatism and enterprise discipline.
